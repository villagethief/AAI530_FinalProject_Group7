## Component Documentation
1. Sensors
Device: Dry-electrode EEG Headset (4-8 channels)
Location: Wearable headset with frontal lobe electrodes
Type: NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 or OpenBCI Ganglion
Technical Specs:
  - Sampling Rate: 512 Hz
  - Resolution: 12-bit ADC
  - Frequency Range: 1-50 Hz
  - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.0
Limitations:
  - Requires skin contact for reliable readings
  - Limited to coarse mental commands (focus/relax states)
  - 2-hour continuous operation battery life
2. Edge Processing
Device: Raspberry Pi 4 with Neural Compute Stick
Specs:
  - Quad-core Cortex-A72 @ 1.5GHz
  - 2GB LPDDR4 RAM
  - Intel Movidius Myriad X VPU
Functions:
  - Signal filtering (50/60 Hz noise removal)
  - Feature extraction (FFT for alpha/beta waves)
  - Basic intent classification (TensorFlow Lite)
  - Local fallback commands
3. Networking

// ... sensor layer ...

[BLE 5.0] → [WiFi 6 Mesh] → [MQTT over TLS 1.3]  

// ... cloud layer ...

→ [AWS IoT Core] → [Kinesis Data Streams]

Protocol Stack:
  - Transport: MQTT-SN for sensor data
  - Encryption: AES-256 for BLE, TLS 1.3 for WiFi
  - QoS: Level 2 (exactly once delivery)
4. Data Pipeline
Storage:
Time-Series: InfluxDB Cloud
Command Logs: MongoDB Atlas
Raw EEG: S3 Glacier (cold storage)
Processing:
Stream Processing: AWS Kinesis
ML Training: SageMaker with PyTorch
Real-time Inference: ONNX Runtime on Edge
Scalability Features:
Auto-scaling Lambda functions for command processing
Edge-to-cloud model synchronization
Distributed MQTT brokers (HiveMQ Cluster)

## Machine Learning Workflow
1. Cloud Training: 3D CNN for spatial-temporal EEG patterns
Edge Deployment: Quantized ONNX model (~5MB)
Active Learning: Continuous feedback loop from user corrections

## Limitations & Mitigations
Latency: 150ms edge processing + 200ms cloud roundtrip
Error Rate: ~15% false positives (mitigated by confirmation blinks)
Capacity: Supports up to 50 concurrent users per hub
